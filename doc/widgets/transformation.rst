Transformation
""""""""""""""

The Transformation widget allows you to modify the axes of the plots so that they
include the size in microns of the camera instead of the size in pixels. With one
dimension datasets you can choose between a RSM transformation or a magnification.
With two or more dimensions you can only apply magnification.
